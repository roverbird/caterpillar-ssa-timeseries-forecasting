Singular Spectrum Analysis for time series forecasting in Python

An example of the implementation of this code can be found in **[Singular Spectrum Analysis Example.ipynb](https://github.com/aj-cloete/pySSA/blob/master/Singular%20Spectrum%20Analysis%20Example.ipynb)**.

I will update the list of references/credits at another time. The research of *[Nina Golyandina](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=1druVRYAAAAJ&hl=it)* from Russia was invaluable in aiding my understanding of this method.

[update 4 April 2017] - Please note that the current version requires a pandas dataframe with a **datetime** formatted index for it to work.  I will push an update soon to allow numpy array inputs.

Please feel free to fork the project and contribute!
